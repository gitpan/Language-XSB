Language/XSB version 0.12
=========================

This package provides a bidirectional interface to XSB
(L<http://xsb.sourceforge.net>).

From the XSB manual:

    XSB is a research-oriented Logic Programming and
    Deductive Database System developed at SUNY Stony Brook.
    In addition to providing all the functionality of
    Prolog, it contains features not usually found in Logic
    Programming Systems such as evaluation according to the
    Well Founded Semantics through full SLG resolution,
    constraint handling for tabled programs, a compiled
    HiLog implementation, unification factoring and
    interfaces to other systems such as ODBC, C, Java, Perl,
    and Oracle


CHANGES

From version 0.10 the public interface is incompatible with previous
versions, some function names have changed, others have changed their
behavior, and new ones are available.
